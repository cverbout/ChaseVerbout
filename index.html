          <h2>Who is Chase V?</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Chase Verbout, a graduate student in Computer Science
            at Portland State University, and a bit of a tech enthusiast. My
            world revolves around programming and problem-solving, with a
            particular knack for Python and C++. My days are mostly filled with
            tutoring and supporting undergrads at PSU, a role that keeps me
            connected to the basics and constantly learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            Professionally, my experiences range from rigorous academic
            coursework to hands-on internships, including an exciting stint at
            NASA. There, I delved into in-space robotics and simulations, a
            venture that perfectly aligned with my passion for space and
            technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside the binary world of programming, I'm an avid explorer of the
            great outdoors, often hiking Oregon's majestic mountains. I'm also a
            basketball fan and a Dungeon Master in D&D sessions, hobbies that
            provide a perfect counterbalance to my tech-centric life.
            <br />
            <br />
            Looking forward, I'm intrigued by the possibilities in game
            development and space exploration. These fields blend my technical
            skills with my curiosity for what lies beyond the known, offering
            thrilling prospects for my future.
            <br />
            <br />
            That's a bit about me, Chase V. Just a student, a tech enthusiast,
            and an adventurer at heart. Thanks for dropping by!
            <br />

          offers an engaging experience with a clear objective. As the player,
          your task is to overcome waves of enemies with different designs,
          speeds, and health by strategically launching fireballs. Together with
          your trusty companion, Droggo, you must navigate through 14
          challenging rounds before confronting the formidable horde leader on
          the 15th round. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable
          experience in utilizing Unity for 2D and 3D object translations, and I
          also had the opportunity to showcase my creativity by designing the
          game's characters.
