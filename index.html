          <h2>Who is Chase V?</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Chase Verbout, a passionate computer scientist based
            in Portland, Oregon. Currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science
            at Portland State University, I'm set to graduate in June 2024. With
            a solid foundation in programming languages like C, C++, C#,
            JavaScript, Python, and more, I'm well-versed in various
            environments and tools. My experience extends to GIS platforms and
            databases, along with proficiency in version control and data
            analysis.
            <br />
            <br />
            In terms of work experience, I serve as a Technical Course Support
            Specialist in the PSU Computer Science Department, providing
            tutoring and grading support for undergraduate CS courses. I also
            have prior internship experience at King County Metro (KCM), where I
            contributed to an open-source project and managed project timelines.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond my tech endeavors, I have a love for outdoor exploration,
            particularly through hiking. Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams are
            among my favorite spots. As a basketball enthusiast, I proudly
            support the Portland Trail Blazers, and I enjoy channeling my
            creativity through D&D as a DM for my friends.
            <br />
            <br />
            Looking ahead, my unwavering passion drives me towards game
            development and space exploration. I aspire to push the boundaries
            of human imagination and understanding. Crafting captivating
            experiences in game development excites me, while the mysteries of
            space inspire me to delve deeper. Through merging technical
            expertise, creativity, and innovation, I aim to shape immersive
            digital worlds and contribute to our understanding of the cosmos.
            Ultimately, my goal is to leave a lasting impact, igniting
            inspiration and paving the way for future exploration and human
            ingenuity.

          I developed a CRUD API using Python that employs MySQL as the
          underlying database system. The API is built on the Tornado framework,
          ensuring a robust and efficient architecture. To enhance performance
          and optimize data access, Redis is utilized as a caching mechanism.
          Thorough testing of the API was conducted using Postman to ensure its
          functionality and reliability.

          could prepare based on their available ingredients or view the
          ingredients required for specific recipes. As part of my role, I
          established the backend infrastructure by hosting a server and MySQL
          database on Azure, ensuring seamless teamwork and data management. I
          took charge of developing the API infrastructure to facilitate smooth

          In my initial venture into game development, I embarked on creating a
          captivating playable game called RoadHero. This 2D side-scroller
          offers an engaging experience with a clear objective. As the player,
          your task is to overcome waves of enemies with different designs,
          speeds, and health by strategically launching fireballs. Together with
          your trusty companion, Droggo, you must navigate through 14
          challenging rounds before confronting the formidable horde leader on
          the 15th round. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable
          experience in utilizing Unity for 2D and 3D object translations, and I
          also had the opportunity to showcase my creativity by designing the
          game's characters.

          CommonPaths is an impressive multi-tenant GIS recording and
          reconciliation system that revolutionizes the collection, processing,
          and distribution of pedestrian pathway data. This innovative solution
          provides users with access to high-quality information about
          pedestrian pathways in a standardized and computable format. Notably,
          CommonPaths excels in accurately describing, translating, and serving

          applications and users, with a particular focus on enhancing
          accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments. Throughout my
          involvement in this project, I gained invaluable experience in project
          planning, creating detailed technical documentation, and assembling
          the project's webpage, all of which have further refined my skills and
          expertise in these areas.
