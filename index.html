          <p>
            Hi! My name is Chase Verbout. Currently, I am a graduate student at
            Portland State University pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer
            Science. I am also a former Husky, graduating from the University of
            Washington in 2021 with a degree in Geography: Data Science.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am largely focused on becoming a well-rounded software engineer
            and captivated by the potential applications of AR/VR. My
            motivations derive from my passion to create new realities for the
            benefit, enjoyment, and exploration of others.
            <br />
            <br />
            *This breathtaking view behind me is from the "peak" of Mt. St
            Helens in WA!

        <p>
          This internship was an extension of my work at UW for CSE 495. Led by
          Anat Caspi, the Director of the UW Taskar Center for Accessible
          Technology (TCAT), I performed tertiary work that assisted with their
          OpenSideWalks (OSW) program. Through this, I was introduced to King
          County Metro (KCM) and their CommonPaths program that operates with
          the same data and structures as OSW.
